The steps to use this program are simple
1. Go to list creation and create a list of assets that you want to train with. The format for creation is you write the name of the tokens separated by spaces such as "AAPL TSLA"
2. Generate lists for Watchlist(For live trading), TrainList(To develop scripts and algorithms), and DataLists(To test the quality of the scripts) 
3. Once the list is generated go to AI script generator and create a script by choosing a TrainList, a root strategy (this is the Pinescript and overall trading strategy) and some other straightforward settings
4. Once your script is generated go to data collection to test it against a large set of data, now you can get thousands of trading strategy summaries and sort them from quality
5. Summary report gives you information on the data collection process at a whole to help you evaluate your scripts
6. Using the three windows mentioned above you can try to construct a watchlist and you can apply those watchlists to Live Trading which will give you a notification when a trade opens with a set script, timeframe, and asset.
